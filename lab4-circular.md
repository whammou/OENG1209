## 7.1 Angular Speed and Angular Acceleration

### Question 1

(a) Find the angular speed of Earth’s rotation about its axis. 
(b) How does this rotation affect the shape of Earth?

### Question 4

> A potter’s wheel moves uniformly from rest to an angular speed of 1.00 rev/s in 30.0 s. 

(a) Find its angular acceleration in radians per second per second.

(b) Would doubling the angular acceleration during the given period have doubled final angular speed?

## 7.3 Relations between Angular and Linear Quantities

### Question 7

> A machine part rotates at an angular speed of 0.06 rad/s; its speed is then increased to $2.2 \frac{rad}{s}$ at an angular acceleration of $0.70 \frac{rad}{s^2}$. 

(a) Find the angle through which the part rotates before reaching this final speed.

</p>

(b) In general, if both the initial and final angular speed are doubled at the same angular acceleration, by what factor is the angular displacement changed? Why?

### Question 8

> A bicycle is turned upside down while its owner repairs a flat tire. A friend spins the other wheel and observes that drops of water fly off tangentially. She measures the heights reached by drops moving vertically (Fig. P7.8). A drop that breaks loose from the tire on one turn rises vertically 54.0 cm above the tangent point. A drop that breaks loose on the next turn rises 51.0 cm above the tangent point. The radius of the wheel is 0.381 m.

> [!NOTE]
> This problem requires the use of circular form of [`eq(3)`](./w4-circular.md#rotation-motion-under-constant-angular-accleration) in the laws of motion and the understanding of [law of energy conservation](./w5-work.md#energy-conservation)

(a) Why does the first drop rise higher than the second drop? 

> There is a negative difference in the first the second drop is due to the loss in the speed of the wheel or the wheel is slowing down results in lower kinetic energy

(b) Neglecting air friction and using only the observed heights and the radius of the wheel, find the wheel’s angular acceleration (assuming it to be constant)

## 7.4 Centripetal Acceleration

### Question 19

> One end of a cord is fixed and a small 0.500 kg object is attached to the other end, where it swings in a section of a vertical circle of radius u 2.00-m, as shown in Figure P7.19. When $\theta = 20.0\textdegree$, the speed of the object is 8.00 m/s. At this instant.

</p>

(a) the tension in the string,

</p>

(b) the tangential and radial components of acceleration, and 
(c) the total acceleration

</p>

(d) Is your answer changed if the object is swinging down toward its lowest point instead of swinging up? 

> There would be __No change__ even if the object swinging down instead of of swinging up

(e) Explain your answer to part (d).

> When the object swinging down its gaining speed and vice versa however both the `tangential acceleration` and `radical acceleration` stays the same in both cases
