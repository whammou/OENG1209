# Dynamics - Newton's Law of Motion

## Forces

### Motion and Forces

* A force is commonly imagined as a push or a pull on some objects, perhaps rapidly (e.g when we hit a tennis ball with a racket)
* Unit convertions: 
```
┌──────┬─────┬─────────────┬─────────────────┐
│System│ Mass│ Acceleration│ Force           │
├──────┼─────┼─────────────┼─────────────────┤
│SI    │ kg  │ m/s^2       │ N = kg*m/s^     │
├──────┼─────┼─────────────┼─────────────────┤
│U.S   │ slug│ ft/s^2      │ lb = slug*ft/s^2│
└──────┴─────┴─────────────┴─────────────────┘
```
* There are two basics calsses of forces:
  * __Contact forces__ are the forces that act on an object by touching it at a point of contact, forexample a string must by tied to an object to pull it
  * __Field force (Long-range forces)__ are the forces that act on an object without physical contact, for instance magnetism is a long-range force

## Newton's Law of Motion

### Newton's First Law of Motion

* An object moves with a `velocity` that is constant in magnitude and direction unless a non-zero net force on it
* The net foce on an object is defined as the vector sum of all external forces exerted on the object.

> [!NOTE]
> _Internal Forces_ originates within the object itself and can _NOT_ change the object's `velocity`.
 

### Newton's Second Law of Motion

* The `acceleration` of an object is proportional to the net force acting on it an inversely proportional to its mass

$$\vec{a} = \frac{\sum \vec{F}}{m}$$

* Component wise formula:

$$\sum F_{x} = ma_{x} \text{ , } \sum F_{y} = ma_{y}$$

### Newton's Third Law of Motion
